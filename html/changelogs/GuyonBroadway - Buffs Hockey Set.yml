# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

changes: 
  - tweak: "Ka-Nada has been taking metrics on your performance in the field and has tweaked the kinetic accelerators in the hockey stick to better match your average agent. It will take four hits to crit an unprotected target and three if you bash them into a wall with each hit."
  - tweak: "Based on the common armaments of your Standard NT Security personnel, Ka-Nada has tweaked their armoured suits with ablative plating to better protect it against lasers and energy, this comes at the cost of protection from ballistics."
  - tweak: "The suit has been adjusted to now accommodate most forms of oxygen tank in its storage slot, the solution was to loosen the strap a bit before shipping. "
  - tweak: "The hockey stick has been better adjusted to reflect %50 of all energy based projectiles back at the attacker including taser electrode. If you want to properly put a Ka-Nada professional down you need to man up and use a stun baton!"
